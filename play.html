    <h3>Play</h3>
		<p>Currently, there are three ways that you can play the Peccaviens demo. You can play it on 
		<a href="https://realjop.itch.io/peccaviens">itch.io</a> 
		<a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/peccaviens/930105">Gamejolt</a> 
		and 
		<a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/959093">Newgrounds</a>.  
		These contains the first section and the prologue. DISCLAMER: This game contains flashing lights!

		<b>Controls</b>
		<p>Arrow keys to move (WASD only works in overworld, not in menus)</p>
		<p>ENTER or CTRL to confirm</p>
		<p>ALT or ESC to cancel (ESC may exit fullscreen on accident in the web ports)</p>
		<p>SHIFT to run (Hold the key to run)</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Web port info:</b>
		Lets talk about the web port and some other ports.
		When the actuall game releases however, there probably won't be a web port. Why? Well, I want to make the full game a paid release, so I can't put it on a website. Instead, you can get the game on whatever platform I release the game on (probably steam)
		Don't worry, the full version shouldn't cost too much! It will probably be less than 10$ but don't quote me on that.
